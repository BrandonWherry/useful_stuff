Keep trash talk centered on the game with no personal attacks.\n\n3) ORP Fobs are not allowed. In addition, do not use multiple tribes to ORP block (such as ORP blocking a cave entrace with one tribe, and playing behind in another, assuming there is only 1 entrance to the cave).\n\n",

If in doubt, ask for clarification. Report offensive terms, but remember that the final decision on their appropriateness rests with an admin.\n\n5) Exploiting game mechanics to gain an unfair advantage in anyway that is not covered by previous rules is covered here. I can't think of every potential cheat/exploit in advance. I will take action case by case if a dispute happens.",
