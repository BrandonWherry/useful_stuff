Keep trash talk centered on the game with no personal attacks.\n\n3) Do not exploit building mechanics on platforms or rafts to avoid turret damage or breach enemy bases. Structures on platforms shouldn't fully enclose dinos or players, except for the rider. For all platform dinos, don't build under the platform. Tek Rifle 'tunnels' on rafts/platforms are not allowed (they are allowed with non-platofrm building).",

In addition, do not use multiple tribes to ORP block (such as ORP blocking a cave entrace with one tribe, and playing behind in another, assuming there is only 1 entrance to the cave).\n\n5) Tribe, player, and dino names, along with any custom text, should exclude derogatory or discriminatory terms. The prohibited words are generally intuitive. If in doubt, ask for clarification. Report offensive terms, but remember that the final decision on their appropriateness rests with an admin.\n\n6) Exploiting game mechanics to gain an unfair advantage in anyway that is not covered by previous rules is covered here. I can't think of every potential cheat/exploit in advance. I will take action case by case if a dispute happens.",
